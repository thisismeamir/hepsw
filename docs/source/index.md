# HEP SW 

Welcome to HEP SW documentation, where we document build process, dependencies, and modules of HEP stack from the ground-up. Due to the fact that most of the documentation of software regarding high-energy physics are either focused on experiment and usage, or consider isolation in their build manuals; [HEPSW](https://github.com/thisismeamir/hepsw) provides a clear, guided, semi-automated build hub for software, and libraries of high-energy physics.


This project is currently maintained by Amir H. Ebrahimnezhad. For discussions, you can contact me on cern mattermost server, and for code issues, bugs, and help open an issue.
